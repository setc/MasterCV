%	What is this?

As everyone know, sending generic non-tuned curriculums is the sure path to not
to be read. But, making a curriculum suited to each job offer may be a lot of
work. Even more if you are aiming to job offers in various countries, each one
of them with his own 'flavor' of curriculum.

So I decided to create a megacurriculum to everything and the kitchen sink in 
as a base to create curriculums ready to send. I just need to comment the parts I
don't need (an maybe reorder some things) and voila, a new curriculum is born.
Of course I can add and rewrite, but in the master version I can keep 
everything just in case.

%      About the Addendums:

I've been thinking about giving added value, not in the CV per se, but putting
a serie of more dettailed addendums just in case my future employers want to 
know more. It doesn't cost a lot of effort more, and unlike the cv, I don't
need to modify it so often.

%		Future Updates:

I'm thinking about another document (an addendum?) where I can put my references
for easy consultation.
